Mistakes C/C++ Developers make writing Go

This repo is an experiment on how C/C++ programmers could write better Go style code. 
Concepts like

* C-style casts are anathema in Go

* C++ Maps should not abuse the Go interfaces by mapping its OOP concepts to Go

* No obfuscated pointer math is necessary.

I'll focus on the architecture of good Go code and problems importing C/C++ code patterns to Go.

New ideas are always welcomed, so you can submit an [issue](https://github.com/Ch3ck/MistakesC-CPP-Devs-MakeInGo/issues) with a question comment or make a [pull request](https://github.com/Ch3ck/MistakesC-CPP-Devs-MakeInGo/pulls) if you see something better can be done. I'll cultimate all these ideas on to a blog a blog post. When I'll post on my [medium](https://medium.com/@checko)
